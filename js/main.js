// Main JavaScript - Imports all modules
// Note: In a real build system, you would bundle these modules
// For now, we'll load them individually in the HTML

// All modules are self-initializing, so we just need to ensure they're loaded
// The modules will handle their own initialization on DOMContentLoaded
